Super Simple Tasks
==================
[supersimpletasks.com](http://supersimpletasks.com)

A very simple tasks app that uses localStorage to save the list. This exists mainly so I can teach myself Coffeescript and better programming in general.

### Features

* No account required - close your browser and come back and your tasks will still be there
* Mobile support
* Extremely simple UI
* Bulk mark all tasks completed

### To-do

* Default tasks
* Add Google Analytics
* Add HTML5 shiv
* Undo
* Drag and drop reorder
* 'Star' a task
* IE support

### Dependencies

Uses [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/). I compile with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) which is pretty great, but any Coffeescript / Stylus compiler will do.
