Super Simple Tasks
==================
[supersimpletasks.com](http://supersimpletasks.com)

A very simple tasks app that uses localStorage to save the list. This exists mainly so I can teach myself Coffeescript and better programming in general.

### Features

* No account required - close your browser and come back and your tasks will still be there
* Mobile support
* Extremely simple UI
* Bulk mark all tasks completed

### To-do

#### 1.2

* Simpler (hate to say it, 'flat') design
* Add priority - minor, major, critical, blocker
* Add due date - today, tomorrow, this week, next week, this month
* Add description field
* Edit tasks

#### 1.3

* Toggle to sort by priority, due date, creation order

#### 1.4

* IE support
* Sync using Chrome's native sync API

### Dependencies

Uses [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/) and [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.com/stylus/). I compile with [LiveReload](http://livereload.com/) which is pretty great, but any Coffeescript / Stylus compiler will do.

There's currently an AngularJS port underway in the angular branch.
